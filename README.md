The objectives of this branch are,
1) Go through API docs in swagger: http://react-cdp-api.herokuapp.com/api-docs API Endpoint: http://react-cdp-api.herokuapp.com/

2) Make your components perform real AJAX requests.

3) Move data fetches to actions and pass data to your components with redux.

4) Cover actions and reducers with unit tests.

5) Add the ability to store your apps state offline and use it to start-up the app. You can take a look at redux-persist library for further reference.
