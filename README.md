The objectives of this branch are,
1) Create package.json file and install React, Redux, React-Redux, React-Router, Jest.

2) Install and configure webpack & babel to get build artifact by running npm command

3) Set DEV and PROD build configuration. Use env variables, dev server, optimizations for PROD build

4) Set up testing. You should have test command in your package.json file, which will run your future tests. Donâ€™t use React boilerplate for this task.

Available commands to run:

### `npm run start`
### `npm run start:dev`
### `npm run test`
